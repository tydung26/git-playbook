# 9 Rules for Merge Requests

## 1. MR Size

Keep changes under **400–500 lines of code** (LOC) and **≤ 10–15 files**.

---

## 2. Focus

Each MR should do **one clear thing** (feature, fix, refactor, style, ci, chore, docs).

---

## 3. Commits

Use **≤ 5 logical commits**, each representing a meaningful step.

---

## 4. Review Time

Target **≤ 60 minutes** of review effort per MR.

---

## 5. Context Clarity

Start the MR with a short summary: **"What," "Why," "How tested"**.

---

## 6. Automation

Automate **linting, tests, and formatting** before review.

---

## 7. Review Frequency

Review small MRs **daily or continuously** instead of batching.

---

## 8. Complexity vs. Size

If the change is conceptually hard, add **inline docs or diagrams**.

---

## 9. Merge Hygiene

**Rebase or update** MR before requesting final review.
